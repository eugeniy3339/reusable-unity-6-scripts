## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Before committing, fetch and pull any recent changes
5. Check the previous update number (e.g., Update 3.9)
6. Name your commit following the pattern: `Update X.Y` where X.Y is the next version number
   - Version numbers use a single decimal point format (e.g., 3.9)
   - When the decimal part reaches 9, increment the whole number and reset the decimal part to 0
   - For example: after 3.9 comes 4.0, after 4.9 comes 5.0
7. **Important**: Add detailed documentation comments at the top of each script file that explain:
   - The purpose of the script
   - How to set up and configure the script
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Usage examples where appropriate
8. Submit a pull request
